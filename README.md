# Functions-Errors-ETH-AVAX

Simple smart contract project using require, assert, and revert statements.

## Description

The SmartContractProject is a Solidity smart contract that serves as the manager for a single piece of data. It uses the need, assert, and reverse statements to ensure the data's integrity and validity.

## Usage/Features

1. Allows you to handle a single uint256 data value.
2. Validate data before updating, checking if the new data is not zero, has a different data value, and is less than the current data to ensure its authenticity and integrity.
3. It uses three error-handling statements (assert, require, and reverse) to restrict data updates and provide error messages when specific criteria are not fulfilled.

### Executing program

* Use any Solidity compiler; I used Remix IDE.
* Go to the solidity compiler and compile the file.
* In the deploy & execute transactions window, click deploy.
* On the deployed contracts panel, check for setData, which allows you to change the data value.

Feel free to set new data values and experiment!

### NOTE

* Look for the green check in every transaction that you make, if you see a green check it means that the transaction went through.
