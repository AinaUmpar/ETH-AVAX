# Functions-Errors-ETH-AVAX

Simple smart contract project using assert, require and revert statements.

## Description

The SmartContractProject is a Solidity smart contract that serves as the manager for a single piece of data. It uses the require, assert, and reverse statements to ensure the data's integrity and validity.

## Usage/Features

1. This allows you to handle a single uint256 data value.
2. It will Validate data before updating, checking if the new data is not zero, has a different data value, and is less than the current data to ensure its authenticity and integrity.
3. It uses three error-handling statements (assert, require, and reverse) to restrict data updates and provide error messages when specific criteria are not fulfilled.

### Executing program

* Use any Solidity compiler; I used Remix IDE.
* search for the solidity compiler and create a file.
* Once done coding, go to the deploy & execute transactions window and click deploy.
* On the deployed contracts panel, check for setData, which allows you to change the data value.

You can also set new data values and explore them!

### NOTE

* Search for the green check in every transaction that you make, if you see it then it means that the transaction went through.
